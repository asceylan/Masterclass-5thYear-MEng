Digital/Computer Forensics:
     "Computer Forensics is the practice of determining the past
     actions that have taken place on a computer system using forensic
     techniques and understanding artifacts." - David Cowen, B3

     "Digital Forensics is "the preservation, recovery, analysis, and
     reporting of digital artifacts." - Andrew Hogg, T1

     "Digital Forensics is a branch of forensic science encompassing
     the recovery and investigation of material found in digital
     devices, often in relation to computer crime." - Wikipedia

What is an Artifact:
     "An Artifact is a reproducible file, setting or system change
     that occurs everytime an application or operating system performs
     a specific action" - David Cowen, B3

Digital Investigation:
     "A digital investigation is a process where we develop and test
     hypotheses that answer questions about digital events." - Brian
     Carrier, B1

Scientific Method:
     "[...]scientific method where we develop a hypothesis using
     evidence that we find and then test the hypothesis by looking for
     additional evidence that shows the hypothesis is impossible." -
     Brian Carrier, B1

Digital Evidence:
     "Digital evidence is a digital object that contains reliable
     information that supports or refutes a hypothesis." - Brian
     Carrier, B1

Digital Forensic Investigation:
     "A digital forensic investigation is a process that uses science
     and technology to analyze digital objects and that develops and
     tests theories, which can be entered into a court of law, to
     answer questions about events that occurred. In other words, a
     digital forensic investigation is a more restricted form of
     digital investigation." - Brian Carrier, B1


Digital Crime Scene Investigation Process - Brian Carrier:
	"The process has three major phases, which are system preservation, evidence searching, and event reconstruction." - Brian Carrier

	| System Preservation | <---> | Evidence Searching | <---> | Event Reconstruction |

	General Guidelines:
		PICL stands for preservation, isolation, correlation, and logging.
		Preservation:	 Preservation of the system being investigated.
		Isolation:	 Isolate the analysis environment from both the suspect data and the outside world.
		Correlation:	 Correlate data with other independent sources. This helps reduce the risk of forged data.
		Logging:	 Log and document your actions. This helps identify what searches you have not yet conducted and what your results were.


Analysis Types:
	 Live Analysis
	      "A live analysis occurs when you use the operating
	      system or other resources of the system being
	      investigated to find evidence." - Brian Carrier, B1

	 Dead Analysis:
	      "A dead analysis occurs when you are running
	      trusted applications in a trusted operating system to
	      find evidence." - Brian Carrier, B1

	 

Aquisition Strategies:



Tools Available:
      Write Blockers: (Aquisition)
            Hardware or software devices that allow gathering of
      	    inforamation without damaging the contents by blocking
      	    write commands while allowing read commands to pass
      	    though.
