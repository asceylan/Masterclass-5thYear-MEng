Lecture 1:
	What is digital?

	Important concepts of the digital forensic process/digital crimescene investigations?
		  Proving/disproving a hypothesis seraching for evdance as such
		  General Phases: Preservation, Evidence Searching, Even Reconstruction [FSFABC]
		  PICL: Preservation, isolation, corrolation, logging. [FSFABC]

	What sub categories are there in digital forensics/Computer science elements envolved in Digital Forensics?

	Types of analysis
	      Live analysis / Dead analysis [FSFABC]

        Run though an example digital forensic scenario
	    possible focuses: file system, or memory forensics.

Lab will use one of the removeable medias currenlty looking into Removable Media #2

Image Format 	DD


Idea 1:
Set up a scenario for the users, a client has stated X thing has occured.
The lab is to develop a case and timeline of events that match the that prove or disprove the hypothesis given.
Follow digital forensic procedure to reliably recreate the device in question, verifiy it wish hashes etc.
Use forensic tools to aid completion of the timeline and make a verdict.
Possibly have small groups each looking at a different device/file system/memory/network traffic.
Depending on how much time or how indepth lecure was.

Tasks?
- Identify the file system in use and other information such as data unit size?


- Search for string in unallocated space.

Recover a deleted file?
icat

- Find a 'flag' in a damaged data unit? or from a data unit that is marked as bad but is not really?

- store flag in unallocated data and ask them to recover it and tell me what data unit within the file system it was in?
