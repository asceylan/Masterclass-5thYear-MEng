		  General Phases: Preservation, Evidence Searching, Even Reconstruction [FSFABC]
		  PICL: Preservation, isolation, corrolation, logging. [FSFABC]

	What sub categories are there in digital forensics/Computer science elements envolved in Digital Forensics?

	Types of analysis
	      Live analysis / Dead analysis [FSFABC]

        Run though an example digital forensic scenario
	    possible focuses: file system, or memory forensics.

:: LAB IDEAS ::
Idea 1:
Set up a scenario for the users, a client has stated X thing has occured.
The lab is to develop a case and timeline of events that match the that prove or disprove the hypothesis given.
Follow digital forensic procedure to reliably recreate the device in question, verifiy it wish hashes etc.
Use forensic tools to aid completion of the timeline and make a verdict.
Possibly have small groups each looking at a different device/file system/memory/network traffic.
Depending on how much time or how indepth lecure was.
